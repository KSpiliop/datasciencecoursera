# Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data - Final Project

Download data from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and unzip to working directory.  

Use Run_Analysis.R to load in .txt files and stitch together into one working data frame.  The R file then subsets only the means and standard deviations of the features and outputs that as a text file output.txt

See CodeBook.MD for variable information.
